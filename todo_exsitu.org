* dataset
** double check area units and high MAE values
** t-1 return type that includes y-spec
** for small train sizes, multiple samples from random indices in the run
* models
** bootstrap model ensemble and runtime selector
** latent space inputs and runtime L-estimator
** supervise updating L
** recurrent L estimator
* analysis
** Switch from raw values to +/- dataset mean
Larger data numbers could look better if the larger datasets happen to be easier to predict. Instead we could look at average deviation from the mean for each dataset? Just a thought.
